"""
Call google_download() if you'd like to update your autocomplete results
with the latest google autocomplete results. Please note that the crawler
may break at certain points in time though.

There is not a fully functional API built on this, so if you want to do anything
you really have to study the code for now... Until someone fixes it.

This is a brief library which uses Google's autocomplete data found publicly and
conveniently packages it into a python importable for your own custom applications.

>>> 26*26
676
>>> 26*26*26
17576

We are stopping here, unless someone wants
to help with multi treading/coring this

>>> 26*26*26*26
456976
>>> 26*26*26*26*26
11881376

Our logic revolves behind not making too many requests to google
We request all permutations of 3 characters, with all 26 lowercase
english letters. aaa, aab, etc

We store a set of every single auto complete result, these are "top results"
For each of these results, we expand them, ex:
    amazon -> a -> amazon
              am -> amazon
              ama -> amazon

This isn't just it though, I will add two param flags for the user.
One allows the user to disable all first person-ish phrases. We know the
infamous google auto complete: how can I ...
                               why do X people ...

Another flag will allow users to add the entire unix (english) dictionary
into their autocomplete results.

More flags will be added in the future.

In the future I will add a module/option allowing users to refresh
their autocomplete systems by resyncing with google. The frequency
of this will be based off your app
